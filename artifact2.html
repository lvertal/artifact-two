<p>The following artifact was originally posted as a discussion response to a prompt in a class CSCL 3220W and has been adapted and expanded upon.</p>
<p>Prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aerial screen cultures Stephen Groening discusses in his<br>
2013 article, in many ways, rely on technology that the aircraft<br>
provides to its visitors/customers as either individual screens<br>
mounted to the backs of seats where customers pick from entertainment<br>
provided by the flight company, or, farther back in history, screens<br>
that were placed throughout the aircraft for shared viewing and would<br>
show content synchronously (entertainment, flight data, flight safety<br>
videos etc).</p>
<p>In recent years it has become somewhat customary for flight companies<br>
to offer such entertainment indirectly, to be accessed through an<br>
in-flight network on the flyers’ personal screen devices.<br>
Alternatively, flyers can bring their own screen entertainment on such<br>
personal devices to their flight.</p>
<p>In what ways does this shift to personal devices change the<br>
dynamics of aerial screen culture as Groening describes it? What are<br>
some benefits or issues that emerge with this personalization?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My Response:</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest changes is in terms of economics - the focus on personal technology further distinguishes wealth even further than it already was in a plane divided by literal “class.” While regular flying is generally a trait of the relatively wealthy and privileged, it is undeniable that the experience for those in the lower brackets who do fly is significantly different from the rich. Generally smaller screens will produce less immersive content, lower quality headphones will leak more of the aircraft’s ambient noise into the viewer’s experience, the poorer fliers are unable to, as the wealthier do, isolate themselves from the physical experience of flying or the experience of their noisy neighbors.</p>
<p>Concerns about accessibility also crop up here not only in terms of cost but also physical access and how cost and physical access compound one another.  Hearing or visually impaired flyers will have the necessary cost for in-flight entertainment raised as they will require more accessories or more high quality accessories to engage with content that is not designed for aircraft enjoyment with noise, vibrations, and small screens dictating viewership.</p>
<p>Of course, in-flight entertainment is generally still available but often on screens that are of inferior quality even to commonly available smartphones. Additionally, cheaper or smaller flights may not even have in-flight entertainment available for some seating options. That said, the acceptance of personalization also brings with it opportunities for more personally relevant content. The ability to bring with you content that you know you can access and enjoy may also alleviate some of the stress of flying.</p>
